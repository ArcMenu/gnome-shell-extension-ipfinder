# IP-Finder

#### IP-Finder Gnome Extension coming soon!

This Gnome extension displays information about your public IP address (hostname, country, AS block etc) and a map image of the IP's geolocation. Useful if you use a VPN, or enjoy checking out your internet traffic.

Note: the ip data is not retrieved using HTTPS (because that requires a paid account with ipinfo.io), so if you ultimate securety, I wouldn't rely on this extension to determine whether or not you are connected to a VPN.
