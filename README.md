# IP-Finder

#### IP-Finder Gnome Extension

This Gnome extension displays information about your public IP address (hostname, country, AS block etc) and a map image of the IP's geolocation. Useful if you use a VPN, or enjoy checking out your internet traffic.

Note: the ip data is not retrieved using HTTPS (because that requires a paid account with ipinfo.io), so if your goal is ultimate securety, I wouldn't rely on this extension as it does not retrive IP lookups using HTTPS for secure lookups.

Note: I've updated the code from growing's repo as its not been updated in over a year ill hopefully be adding more features to this extension over time, but as of now it currently works with gnome 3.20 and 3.22 and I'm currently working on 3.24.
